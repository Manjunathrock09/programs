            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</article>

            JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
             JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
             Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.

JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

What is JavaScript
JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
Features of JavaScript
There are following features of JavaScript:

All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
It is a case-sensitive language.
JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
History of JavaScript
In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.

            SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

            Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.
            SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.

SQL is not a database system, but it is a query language.

Suppose you want to perform the queries of SQL language on the stored data in the database. You are required to install any database management system in your systems, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc

            Python is a popular programming language.
        Python can be used on a server to create web application.Python Tutorial | Python Programming Language
        Python
        Python is a widely used programming language that offers several unique features and advantages compared to languages like Java and C++. Our Python tutorial thoroughly explains Python basics and advanced concepts, starting with installation, conditional statements, loops, built-in data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Generators, Exception Handling, Python RegEx, and many other concepts. This tutorial is designed for beginners and working professionals.
        
        In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum dreamed of developing Python. The first version of Python 0.9.0 was released in 1991. Since its release, Python started gaining popularity. According to reports, Python is now the most popular programming language among developers because of its high demands in the tech realm.
        
        What is Python
        Python is a general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected, and purely object-oriented programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
        Features of Python:
        Easy to use and Read - Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers. This simplicity can lead to faster development and reduce the chances of errors.
        Dynamically Typed - The data types of variables are determined during run-time. We do not need to specify the data type of a variable during writing codes.
        High-level - High-level language means human readable code.
        Compiled and Interpreted - Python code first gets compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted line by line. When we download the Python in our system form org we download the default implement of Python known as CPython. CPython is considered to be Complied and Interpreted both.
        Garbage Collected - Memory allocation and de-allocation are automatically managed. Programmers do not specifically need to manage the memory.
        Purely Object-Oriented - It refers to everything as an object, including numbers and strings.
        Cross-platform Compatibility - Python can be easily installed on Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, allowing developers to create software that runs across different operating systems.
        Rich Standard Library - Python comes with several standard libraries that provide ready-to-use modules and functions for various tasks, ranging from web development and data manipulation to machine learning and networking.
        Open Source - Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.
        Python has many web-based assets, open-source projects, and a vibrant community. Learning the language, working together on projects, and contributing to the Python ecosystem are all made very easy for developers.

            Java is a popular programming language.
            Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.
            Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
Application
According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
Mobile
Embedded System
Smart Card
Robotics
Games, etc.
Types of Java Applications
There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:

1) Standalone Application
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

2) Web Application
An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
3) Enterprise Application
An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

4) Mobile Application
An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
